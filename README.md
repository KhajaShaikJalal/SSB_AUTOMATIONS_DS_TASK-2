## Data Science Internship Task 2: Basic Plotting

This repository contains the files related to the second task of my Data Science internship at SSB Automations. In this task, I performed basic plotting using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions.

### Task Description

- **Objective**: Create basic plots (histograms and scatter plots) to visualize data distributions.
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

### Files Included

- **Task2.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code to generate the plots.
- **events.csv**: The dataset used for the task.
- **histogram_plot.png**: Image file of the histogram plot.
- **scatter_plot.png**: Image file of the scatter plot.

### Installation and Setup

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the plots, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
